## Usama Amir

Ex-civil engineer/accredited project manager and software engineering bootcamp graduate seeking a junior software engineer role. Being actively involved in managing automation technologies within the civil engineering industry, I realised the profound impact of technology across the industry and this ignited my interest in transitioning to a career in the technology sector.

Since completing the Makers bootcamp I have returned to my previous employer and am continuing to hone my skills through working with various departments in the company to develop tools to automate processes using my newly acquired skills, and pursuing further personal projects, I am keen to use the analytical, team working and mathematical abilities developed throughout the bootcamp and my previous career to make a meaningful impact as a software engineer.

Technologies: Python, Javascript, Flask, React, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, HTML/CSS, Git, GitHub.

## Work Experience

**Ramboll/WSP** (Sep 2015 - Present)  
Senior Civil Engineer/Project Manager

- Extensive analytical and problem-solving skills demonstrated through 7+ years of experience as a civil design engineer.
- Managed multi-million pound HS2 work packages and teams of up to 30 engineers and ensured timely and high quality delivery of projects.
- Proven communication skills through chairing regular meetings with clients and stakeholders to understand requirements, manage expectations and resolve conflicts.




## Skills

#### Analytical Thinking and Problem Solving
- As a civil design engineer I have experience in extracting project requirements from a client brief, breaking down the project into manageable chunks and analysing complex problems to devise effective solutions with measurable positive outcomes. An example of this is when I contributed to the design of a new motorway junction which reduced journey times by 10% whlie also reducing net carbon emissions.
- These skills carry over very well into software engineering, allowing me to contribute to devising solutions and using my problem solving skills for debugging.


#### Attention to detail
- Attention to detail was a vital skill both as an engineer and as a project manager. As an engineer I ensured small details on design drawings were accurate as any mistakes could have significant health and safety impacts during and after construction. Attention to detail was also important as a project manager as I was responsible for reporting accurate cost and programme updates to the client on a regular basis.
- This is an essential skill for writing clean and error-free code.


#### Communication and Teamwork
- As a project manager I have vast experience in communcating with clients and external stakeholders to fully understand project requirements, communicate any issues effectively and resolve conflicts to enable a positive outcome for everyone.
- I have also used my communication skills to lead teams of engineers to meet deadlines and keep team morale high through regular meetings and fostering an open culture.
- Many projects also required public consultations which involved presenting solutions to the general public and breaking down technical concepts to non-technical audiences in a manner such that they were able to understand. 


## Education

#### Makers Academy (May 2023 - Sep 2023)

- Object oriented programming in Python and Javascript web applications, with particular emphasis on TDD and pair programming.
- Relational and non-relational databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- Test-driven development using various testing frameworks including Pytest, Jest and Cypress, ensuring production quality code.
- Group projects undertaken using agile best practices including daily stand-ups, retros and short delivery cycles, emulating a development team environment.

#### University College London (2010 - 2014)

- Master of Civil Engineering, International Prgramme
- Second Class Honours

#### A-Levels (2008 - 2010)

- Mathematics (A*)
- Further Mathematics (A)
- Physics (A)



## Hobbies
